====================

Now we make the X Sense HAT into a compass so that we don't get lost.

Azimuth Bearing
-----------------

Azimuth Bearing refers to the number on the outer circle and the Azimuth is the angle from the north direction line to the target direction line in a clockwise direction.
For example, 0 degrees is the direction of true north, and 30 degrees is the direction of 30Â° east by north.

Quadrant Bearing
-------------------

Quadrant Bearing divides the direction of the compass into eight equal parts. For example, the NE direction is between 22.5 degrees and 67.5 degrees.
And between 67.5 degrees and 112.5 degrees is the E direction.
