Introduce Ezblock Studio
-----------------------------

Help the Raspberry Pi configure WiFi through Bluetooth, and then let the Raspberry Pi and Ezblock Studio establish communication through Wi-Fi.
Ezblock Studio is a new open-source platform for building electronic projects and graphical programming.

Ezblock Studio also serves as a coding platform that runs on your phone, tablet and computer. In addition, the Ezblock Studio 
applies Blocks and Python, making it easier to learn programming. By and large, Ezblock Studio integrates Hardware Simulator, 
Bluetooth Debugger, IoT Panel and Customizable Remote Controller, which are conducive to the operation of prototyping, debugging, and so on.

Open App Store (iOS/Mac OS X system) or Play Store (Android/Windows/Linux system), then search and download Ezblock Studio.
